## Set Up

How to use the adapter is explained in the [prooph/event-store docs](https://github.com/prooph/event-store/blob/master/docs/snapshots.md). To help you with setting up the snapshot tables we ship a [SnapshotStoreSchema](src/Schema/SnapshotStoreSchema.php) helper with the package. You can use it in a doctrine migrations script or manually by passing in a `Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Schema` and executing the generated SQL afterwards.

## Interop Factory

Some general notes about how to use interop factories shipped with prooph components can be found in the [event store docs](https://github.com/prooph/event-store/blob/master/docs/interop_factories.md).
Use the [doctrine snapshot adapter factory](src/Container/DoctrineSnapshotAdapterFactory.php) to set up the adapter. If your IoC container supports callable factories
you can register the factory under a service id of your choice and configure this service id as `$config['prooph']['snapshot_store']['adapter']['type'] = <adapter_service_id>`.
